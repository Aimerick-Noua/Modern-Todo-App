# ToDo App

## Overview
The ToDo App is a simple yet effective task management tool that allows users to:
- Add new tasks
- Update existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Track task completion status

This application is built entirely using a component-based architecture in the Angular framework, without the use of services. The [SweetAlert](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) library is integrated for confirmation dialogs and task completion alerts.

### Features
1. **Add Task**: Users can easily add tasks to their list.
2. **Update Task**: Modify task details with ease.
3. **Delete Task**: Remove tasks permanently with a confirmation dialog.
4. **Mark as Completed**: Track progress by marking tasks as completed.
5. **User-Friendly Alerts**: SweetAlert is used for providing confirmations and notifications.

### Limitations
- No form validations are currently implemented (coming in future updates).
